Hi! @vitormlps // Vitor here ðŸ‘‹

I'm studying Systems Analysis and Development, currently learning software engineering, OOP, web programming and databases.
Also am interested in back-end development, dynamically typed languages, agile methodology and process organization.

Since I'm just starting, I don't yet know what to collaborate on. But, someday soon (I hope), I will. ðŸ˜¬

Well, thx for reading it all! You can reach me @ vitor.mlps@gmail.com
